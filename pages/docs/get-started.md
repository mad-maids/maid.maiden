# Get Started

### Stacks

Basicly, you can use any client in order to extract data from api. Any programming language is welcomed!

However, Mad Maids dev teams suggests you to use proper library or frameworks on proper cases in order to
be avoid from various problems.

If your engine is Node.js, then (ordered in priority):

- Node Fetch
- Axios

If you're using Deno, then (ordered in priority):

- Fetch
- Request

If you're using Python, then (ordered in priority):

- Requests & Json
- Urrlib & Json

For the rest programming languages or technologies, try to stick to the native solution for better performance.
