# Maiden

**Maiden** (or **Maid API**) is a server side api created for third party
applications using REST technologies.

> Brought to you by Mad Maids

Westminster has an outdated intranet with its mobile application. However, it doesn't
have api which can be used by third party applications made by students or some
developer who wants to make our academic life more convenient and accessible.

Therefore, Mad Maids came into a decision to create an API server for WIUT
students in order to make the process of data collection much easier and
convenient. Mad Maids share with their data collected by their volunteers via
this API using 2 platforms namely [Denoland] and [Node.js].
